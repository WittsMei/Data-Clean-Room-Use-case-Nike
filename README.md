# Data-Clean-Room-Use-case-Nike

### Challenge

Advertisers like Nike, spending large sums on networks such as Facebook and Google, find it difficult to determine if a specific targeted customer (e.g., Customer A) actually viewed their ad. This is because ad networks are reluctant or legally unable to share all customer data with advertisers due to privacy concerns. However, these ad networks do want to provide advertisers with more insights to help them optimize their marketing strategies.


### The Solution with a DCR
A data clean room allows an ad network (like Facebook), which has data on ad views, and an advertiser (like Nike), which has a list of customers, to securely join their data. This joining happens without either party fully exposing all their data to the other.


### Benefits and Capabilities
Through a DCR, the advertiser (Nike) can run specific, agreed-upon queries on the combined dataset. 
Examples of such queries include:
- What percentage of female individuals seeing the advertisement are actually clicking through?
- Is the advertisement resonating more with high-income or low-income individuals?
This process facilitates secure collaboration, which is revolutionary in advertising, as many ad networks were previously "black boxes" from an analytics perspective. Major advertisers like Google are already offering DCR solutions, with Google's Audience Data Hub being a prime example.









While analytics and advertising analytics are the primary use cases, the video also mentions other applications for data clean rooms:
* **Marketing Activation and Product Use Cases**: DCRs are not limited to just analytics; they can facilitate marketing activation and even product-related use cases.
* **Joint Marketing Campaigns**: An example given is Hilton and Southwest Airlines wanting to run a joint marketing campaign to offer a promotion to mutual power users. A DCR allows them to identify overlapping customers without each company sharing all their customer data, enabling them to activate that specific segment for marketing.

It's also noted that while many examples involve two parties, there is **no technical limit to the number of parties** that can participate in a data clean room, potentially involving hundreds in the future.
